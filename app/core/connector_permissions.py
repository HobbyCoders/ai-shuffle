"""Tell a connector chat that its agent is waiting for the owner's approval.

Tool approvals for connector-linked sessions belong to the OWNER, not to
whoever is talking to the bot: the durable ``pending_interactions`` row, the
WebSocket broadcast and the mobile push created by the permission handler are
the only ways to answer, exactly as for a web session. The chat gets one line
saying the agent is waiting, so the person there knows why nothing happens.
The platform Approve/Deny buttons are no longer sent, and
``ConnectorManager.handle_permission_response`` ignores any that remain in old
chat history.

Called best-effort from the permission request path: ANY failure (connector
not running, platform send error, lookup miss) must never break the
permission flow itself. An unanswered request still ends with the 300-second
TTL deny.
